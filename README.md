# A Simple Key-Logger using Python
**⚠️ WARNING: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!** 
 
## Prepare your environment
```
pip install pynput

```
## Package the script as an Executable
```
 pip install pyinstaller
 pyinstaller --onefile keylogger.py
```

+ This will generate a (keylogger.exe).
+ Make sure to run these command in your VS code Terminal.
+ Once you ran these commands in your terminal it will generate a (keylogger.exe) inside your dist file.
+ You need to copy only that (keylogger.exe) in to your pen and once the USB plugged in, you need to open the (keylogger.exe) manually.
+ This doesn't work on Windows 11 when the USB plugged in because of the Windows Saftey
